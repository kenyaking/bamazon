# bamazon

This application is an online storefront that accepts orders from customers and updates its stock inventory as customers buy the product. 

The challenge the app solves is updating the inventory after items are purchased and adding up the total cost for the product once the item is purchased. The app also alerts customers is there is no enough quantity to fill the order. 

The app is run by typing in the command node bamazonCustomer.js and answering the questions that appear in the terminal.  

Technologies used in the app include: MySQl, Node.js, CLI Table, Inquirer 

My role was writing the code for the app. Links to screen shots showing the app is working are below.
